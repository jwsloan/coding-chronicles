# Getting Started

There are many things I struggle with in life. Chief among them are the close cousins of Getting Started and Finishing. 

I have a hard time starting things, because I tend to feel like I need to have it all figured out first. I need to know how it is all going to go so that I can make sure I don't fail. If I fail at something, that means I'm a failure, and I don't want to be a failure. So, I just don't start. 

Then, if I'm able to start, it is very likely that I won't finish. If I never finish, then I still can't fail. I can sit and tell myself about how great it would have been if I could have just finished. Sometimes the fear isn't even of failure, I think. I think I'm afraid of succeeding as well. I might succeed at this thing, and it turns out that it just didn't matter. It wasn't nearly as impactful or important or good as I thought it would be. 

Failure is scary. Success is scary. Not starting is safe. Not starting is easy.

## This "Blog"

I've thought many times about starting a blog. But would I do a good enough job? Would anyone even read it? If they did, would they like it or get anything out of it? Do I even have anything worth saying? I've never been sure, so I've never tried. 

I have friends who have been blogging about various things software development/engineering related for a long time, and I enjoy following along. I've almost been inspired a few times. 

Then my friend [Alex MacArthur](https://www.macarthur.me/) wrote an article about [Generators in Javascript](https://www.macarthur.me/posts/destructuring-with-generators). It just so happened that I had just been making use of Generators in Python. I chimed in on his post [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7035382616199503872?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7035382616199503872%2C7035415316230782976%29) about my related experience, and once again got the urge to start a blog. I could write up something about Generators in Python!

This is where my usual cycle of excitement, overwhelm, and giving up before starting would usually kick in. It still might. Who knows if I'll ever publish this anywhere. 

Knowing that I needed try to get over the Getting Started hurdle as fast as possible before I chickened out, I [tweeted about my desire](https://twitter.com/JohnWSloan/status/1630079290153873408?s=20) asking for tips on Getting Started.

A friendly-seeming chap named [Tristan Hood](https://twitter.com/The_TristanHood) replied to my tweet. He said:

> The first one can be hard if you think you need to find a topic for it. I’d say you don’t really have anything to say. If that statement irritates you, write a response and post it. Maybe as a blog. Don’t just write a blog. Share something you want to say.

I was honestly a bit confused by that reply, and had a fairly short response.

> I have a topic I want to talk about.

The shortness of my reply could have been taken a number of ways, but Mr. Hood didn't skip a beat. He says:

>Sweet! That’s the hard part. Now just talk about it and release it. Start. There’s no time like today. I use substack. Create a blog, post something, and share it. Sent it to me. I’ll read it. No need to be perfect, just launch.

I've heard these kinds of sentiments before, but it hit me differently this time. I had the thought `Just how simple could I start?` What if I just like wrote REAMDEs in a GitHub repo? What if I didn't even worry about remembering how GH Pages works? What if I just wrote some stuff about generators in Python and `git commit`ed it, and linked to it from my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JohnWSloan) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnwsloan/).

Why not? Even if it's terrible, does that really matter? Do I even need to edit it? Not really. If someone sees some terrible spelling or grammar or whatever, and it bothers them enough, they can just make a pull request! ha!

So, here is my first post. It's not what I was thinking of when I told Tristan I had a topic, and I'm not going to edit it, so it might not be very coherent, but it's a start, and starting feels like a victory right now.
