# Coding Chronicles

> Chronicle: a factual written account of important or historical events in the order of their occurrence.

I don't think anything I'll write here will be important or historical, but I like the sound of the name, so I'm rolling with it. 

I don't plan on doing much editing of these posts. I type/delete/re-type posts on social media and then maybe don't even end up hitting send. Best to just type as I think and then `git push`.
