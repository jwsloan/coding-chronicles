# Coding Chronicles

> Chronicle: a factual written account of important or historical events in the order of their occurrence.

I don't think anything I'll write here will be important or historical, but the name reminds me of one of my favorite TV series that didn't last very long, [The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103586/). 


I don't plan on doing much editing of these posts. I type/delete/re-type posts on social media and then maybe don't even end up hitting send. Best to just type as I think and then `git push`.
